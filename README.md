This is a prototype exploring the possibilities of creating editing
environments that allow learners to tinker with non-trivial HTML, CSS, and
JS without needing any of the following:

* experience with typing unusual characters like semicolons and brackets;
* knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS syntax;
* a large screen;
* a physical keyboard.

In short, the goal is to provide a bit of scaffolding that familiarizes
learners with code, fosters *code reading* literacies, and allows them
to tinker with something and make it their own in an environment that
isn't frustrating.
